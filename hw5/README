1. The state space is P_{i, j, k} where i is the player’s score, j is the opponent’s score and k is turn total.
2. P_roll = 1/36(1-P(j, 0, 0)) + 5/18(1 - P(j, i, 0)) + 1/36(P(i, j, k + 4))  + 1/18(P(i, j, k + 5))  + 1/12(P(i, j, k + 6)) + 1/9(P(i, j, k + 7))  + 5/36(P(i, j, k + 8)) + 1/9(P(i, j, k + 9)) + 1/12(P(i, j, k + 10)) + 1/18(P(i, j, k + 11)) + 1/36(P(i, j, k + 12))
P_hold = 1 - P(j, i + k, 0)

4. A player should generally try to roll ~20 if the scores are close to one another in the early-mid game.
As the margin between player and opponent widens, so does the minimum hold number. 
If the margin is very dramatic, the player should try to win the game in one turn. 
As the game advances, the score difference that dictates whether the player should win the game in one roll decreases. 
If player is close to winning (score > 65) and their opponent is not too far behind, they should try to win in one turn.
If a player is close to winning and their opponent is far behind, they should hold earlier since they will probably have more chances to win.
